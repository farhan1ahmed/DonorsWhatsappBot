# DonorsWhatsappBot
This repository contains code for a **Whatsapp Bot**. The purpose of the Whatsapp Bot was to serve as an active directory, where people can get information regarding interested blood plasma donors. The need of this application was seen extensively during the COVD-19 pandemic, where people were in dire need of blood plasma for their patients.
